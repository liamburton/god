Gigantic Object Database - Relation based data organization

## About

This is a project that I have started and restarted umpteen million times
over the years, switching server and client types as well as the very
core concept of it.  It has now become such a huge amalgamation in my head
I'll never be able to finish it.

With that being said, it is originally designed to be a way of tracking
information that can have other data linked to any other piece of data.
This allows the user to visually follow a "flow" of information as well
as dynamically creating complex objects from simple fields of data.

Originally the interface was going to allow many types of data and be
able to self-reference its own data for formatting instructions.  This
is where the *data type* field would have come in to play.  The current
version here is a simple python console interface.

Anyone interested in still working on this drop me a line and I can
give more details into what I was trying to accomplish.

## Installation

If you already have sqlite3 and python installed it's a simple clone
by issuing

```
git clone https://github.com/liamburton/god
```

## Usage

It's pretty straight forward.  Will write up a real usage guide at some
point.
